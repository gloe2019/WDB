Absolute Units
PX- most commonly used absolute unit. 1px does not necessarily equal the width of one pixel. Note: PX is not recommended for responsive websites

Relative Units
Percentages(%)
percentages are always relative to some other value
Sometimes it's a value from the parent and other times it's a value from the element itself
    ex: width: 50% -> this means the width is 1/2 the width of the parent element
Note: for some properties, percentages work differently. They are relative to the element itself, rather than the parent.
    ex: line-height: 50% --> half the font-size of the element itself..


Rem - Root Ems
- These are relative to the root html element's font-size. Easier to work with than ems.
    If the root font-size is 20px, 1rem=20px, 2rem=40px, etc - ALWAYS.
