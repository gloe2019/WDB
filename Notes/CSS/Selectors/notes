Universal selector
    - Select everything!
    * {
        property: value
    }
    ex: make all text black
        * {
            color: black;
        }

Element selector
    - Select every of a given Element
    ex: specify the size for every image to be 100px wide and 200px tall
        img {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
        }

Selector List
    - Combine multiple selectors in a List
    ex: select all h1s and h2's
        h1, h2 {
            color: magenta;
        }

ID Selector
    - Select only the element with the specified ID
    ex: select the element with id of 'logout'
        #logout {
            color: orange;
            height: 200px;
        }
    Note: id's should only be used once on any given page - you must never reuse an id in multiple elements!
    ID's are meant to be unique identifiers. Use them minimally...


Class Selector
    - Select elements with the specified class
    ex: select elements with class of 'complete'
        .complete {
            color: green;
        }
Note: a class can be applied to multiple elements for styling repetitive elements :)

Descendant Selector
    - Select nested elements...
    ex: select all <a>'s nested inside an <li>
        li a {
            color: teal;
        }

Adjacent Selector (Combinator)
    - Select element immediately adjacent to some specified element...
    ex: select only the paragraghs that come right after an <h1> (not nested)
        h1 + p {
            color: red
        }

Direct-Descendent Selector
    - Select only elements that are direct children of a specified element
    ex: select only the <li>'s that are direct children of a <div> element
        div > li {
            color: white;
        }

Attribute Selector
    - Select  elements having the specified attribute
    ex: select all input elements where the type attribute is set to "text"
        input[type="text"] {
            width: 300px;
            color: yellow;
        }
    
    Note: You can select one element type with specified class (assuming multiple elementy types have the same class)
        ex: <section> and <aside> both have the class=post. To select just sections with that class:
    section.post {
    }

Pseudo Classes
    - these are keywords added onto to the end of a selector that specify a special state of the selected element
        ex: :hover
        Ref: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes

Pseudo elements
    - these are keywords added to a selector that allow you style a particular part of the selected elements
    ex - ::after, ::before, ::first-letter, ::first-line, ::selection

CSS Cascade
    - The order your styles are declared in and linked to matters.
    - If you have 2 stylesheets linked in your <head>, and you've targetted the same selectors in both, the rules in the second sheet (last) are applied.
    - The last-read rule 'wins'

Specificity
    -This is how the browser decides which rules to apply in the event of a conflict.
    - It is a measure of hows specific a given selector is - the more specific selector 'wins'
