What is CSS?
    CSS allows us to style and layout HTML elements on a page
    - language used to describe the visual representation/apperance of an HTML document
    CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

CSS Rules
    Basic pattern
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    ex: make all h1 elements purple:
    h1 {
        color: purple;
    }
    ex: make all img elements 100px wide, 200px tall
    img {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
    }
    ex: select every other text input and give it a red border 
    input[type="text"]:nth-of-type(2n) {
        border: 2px solid red;
    }

CSS can be intimidating because of how many properties we can manipulate! Don't Panic!

Including Styles Correctly
- There are three ways to include styles in your HTML documents, however only one way is acceptable!
    Wrong ways:
    - Inline Styles --> writing your styles directly inline on each element. No bueno!
    - The <style> element -> writing CSS inside a <style> element nested in <head>. Nah G...
    The Right Way:
    - External Stylesheet --> writing your CSS in a .css file and including the stylesheet using a <link> in the head of your HTML doc.


Common CSS Properties
    Color
    - set the  text color 
    Background-color
    - set background color of and element
    Background
    - Note: this is more powerful, and has more options than background-color

CSS Colors
    - Modern browsers support 140 named colors -> ref: https://htmlcolorcodes.com/color-names
    - Using named colors are pretty limited as a typical computer can display ~16m colors... We can use color systems to target more colors.
        RGB Model
        - additive color system - a color can be made from combinations of red, green and blue. Each channel ranges from 0 - 255
        - ex:   rgb(255, 0, 0) - pure red
                rgb(0, 0, 255) - pure blue
                rgb(0, 0, 0) - black
        
        Hex 
        - still red green and blue channels from 0-255, however they are represented with hexadecimal numbers.
        - 6 numbers consisting of 3 pairs. 1st pair = red, 2nd pair = green, 3rd pair = blue
        ex: #0f5679
