- HTML = content + structure of page 
- HTML is a markup language. You annotate/add content to documents
- To write HTML, we pick from a set of defined/standardized elements. Elements are created by writing tags, and most elements consist of an opening and a closing tag
    ex: 
    Opening tag --> <p>I am a paragraph</p> <-- Closing tag
