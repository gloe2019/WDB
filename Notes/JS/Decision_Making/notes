- Boolean Logic is a key concept to understand in programming...
- Decision making refers to having different outcomes based on different types of criteria --> different branching paths base don different inputs...

Comparison Operators
> // greater than
< // less than
>= // greater than or equal to
<= // less than or equal to
When these operators are used, they return a boolean value based on the values they are applied to:
 1 > 3 -> false..
 1 < 3 --> true...


Double vs Triple Equality
== // equality -- Just checks for equality of type and coerces them to be the same type i norder to compare them... ex 1 == '1' -> true!
!= // not equal
=== // strict equality --> Checks for equality of value AND type
!== // strict non-equality
Typically, use strict equality and non-equality to evaluate whether things are the same

Console, Alert & Prompt

console.log - print out something to the console

alert () - Print out popup message to user

prompt ("") - popup that takes user input.
Normally, prompts are saved as variables in order to store user input...
ex: let userNum = prompt("please enter a number)
Note - to turn a string from userinput into a number:
parseInt(variable-name)
    ex: parseInt(userNum)

===========================
Running Code from a File
    - Write code in a .js File
    - Include .js script in your .html file


===========================
Conditionals
    If Statement - only runs code if the given condition is true.
        ex:
        let rating = 3;
        if (rating === 3) { -- NOTE: condition must evaluate to true or false
            console.log("YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!"); --> if TRUE, the code will execute..
        }
        If the conditional is false, ONLY the code inside the curly braces doesn't run. The rest of the code on the subsequent lines are still executed!

    Else If Statement - if not the first thing, maybe try this other thing.
        ex:
        let rating = 2;
        if (rating === 3) { 
            console.log("YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!");
        }
        else if (rating === 2) {
            console.log("MEETS EXPECTATIONS");
        }
        NOTE: else if only runs if the first condition stated in the if statement is false!

=============================
Truthy Falsy
    - Every element in JS has an inherent truthy-ness or falsy-ness to it.
    - Everything in JS is 'truthy' except: false, 0, null, ""(empty string) and NaN


=============================
Logical Operators
    - These are operators that allow us to combine different expressions - Combine multiple pieces of logic together into one.
    - There are 3 core logical operators builtin to JavaScript:
        - AND (&&)
        - OR (||)
        - NOT(!)
    -------------------------
    AND (&&)
    - This joins an expression on the left to an expresison on the right.
    - For the entire thing to be considered true, both side must be true!
        ex:
        1 <= 4 && 'a' === 'a'; //true
        9 > 10 && 14 <= 19; //false as 9 < 10
    --------------------------
    OR (||)
    - If one side is true, the entire thing is considered true!
    ex:
    let age = 76;
    if (age < 6 || age >= 65){
        console.log("You get in for free!");
    }
    else {
        console.log("That will be $10 please!")
    }
    -------------------------
    NOT (!)
    - This doesn't combine two expressions, but operates on expression.
    - !expression returns TRUE if the expression was ORIGINALLY false
        !false //true
        !(1 === 1) //false
        !0 //true -- this flips the inherent falsyness of 0 to truthy
        !null //true 

    -------------------------
    The SWITCH statement
    - This is another control-flow statement that can replace multiple if statements.
    Note: the switch statement is not commonly used, so it's not that important to memorize....
    - For the switch statement to work, two key pieces must be present in your code -> 'switch' and 'case'
