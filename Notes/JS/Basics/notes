JS = Action that happens on Webpage!

Primitive & The Console
    Primitive Types - basic building blocks/data types that JS can interact with...
        Basic Primitive types in JS = Number; String; Boolean; Null; Undefined
        Numbers
        - JS has only one number type - it includes positive, negative, whole and decimal numbers... (no floats like python...)
        - Math operators builtin to JS = + - * /
        Other ones: Modulo = % -- gives remainder of division
                    Exponentiation - **

WTF is NaN?
    - NaN = Not a number. It is a numeric value that represents something that is not a number...
    It is considered a number by JS, but it represents something that is not a number. 
    Ex:
    0/0 -- NaN
    typeof NaN = "number"
    typeof 0/0 = "NaN"

Variables & let
    - Variables are like labels for values. 
        - We can store a value and give it a name so we can refer back to it later, use it to do stuff, or change it later to another value...
        Basic syntax for declaring a vvariable:
        let someName = value;
        ex: let year = 1985;
        you can then type the variable name into console and the value will be displayed. 
        To update a value of a stored variable:
        variable = newValue
        When you update a variable to anew value, any other variables that were dependent on the previous value of it are unchanged.
        ex:
        numHens = 6
        numRoosters = 1
        totalChickens = numHens + numRoosters
        totalChickens = 7
        if you update numHens
        numHens = 9
        totalChickens is still = 7 - unless you redefine it...
    
    Updating Variables
    let score = 0;
    to add 5 to the score: score = score + 5; OR score += 5; 
    increment by 1: score++;
    subtract: score -= 5;
    decriment by 1: score--;
    multiplication: score *=2;
    division: score /=5;

Const & Var
    Const
    - Const works like let, except you cannot change the value. It is CONSTANT!
    const luckyNum = 17;
    Why use const?  - to store immutable values! 
        ex: const pi = 3.14159;
            const daysInWeek = 7;
    Const becomes more useful once you learn about Arrays & Objects

    Var
    - Originally, this was the only way to declare variables. var is the OG.. but it's super geriatric now, so you might be better off leaving it or using it sparsely. 

Booleans
    Booleans easy - only two possible options: true OR false.
    ex:
    let isLoggedIn = true;
    let gameOver = false;
    const isWaterWet = true;
    Booleans are really important for performing logic, making decisions, etc.

Note: in JS, variables can change Types! They are not stuck in their predefined types...
ex:
let numKitties = 21;
 numKitties = true;
 numKitties - 100
