Semantic Elements
Instead of Divs, use more specific elements like:
<section>, <article>, <nav>, <main>, <header>, 
<footer>, <aside>, <summary>, <details>-->

<main>
The <main> element represents the dominant content of the body of a document. Main content of page, and should exclude content that is replicated across a set of documents - ex: nav bar, search, sidebar.
</main>

<nav>
This represents anything on the page that provides navigation links. Could be internal or external links.
</nav>

<section>
This represents a standalone section of a document. It's generic, but can be useful for sorting/breaking up content on a page. 
</section>
